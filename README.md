# Acessible Landmarks üèõÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è

This is the repository for Acessible Landmarks: 3D puzzles of landmarks made for the visually disabled. Our goals are to:

1. Adapt existing puzzles for the visually disabled.

2. Enhance the travel and learning experiences of the visually blind with an empathsis on history and architecture. 

3. Integrate Internet of Things and other technologies to improve the overall product in a meaningful way.

Our current 3D Puzzle is a "pizza-ed" up Colosseum, on a board driven by several light sensors. Each piece is marked with a color,
