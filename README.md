# Acessible Landmarks

This is the repoistory for the **in progress** project Acessible Landmarks (temporay name): 3D puzzles of landmarks made for the visually disabled. Our guiding questions are:

1. How do we adapt existing puzzles for the visually disabled?

2. How can we enhance the traveling experience for the visually disabled?

3. How can we integrate Internet of Things and other technologies into this project?
